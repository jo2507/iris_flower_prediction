# 🌸 Iris Flower Prediction

A *Flask Web App* that predicts the species of Iris flower using *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)* and *Naive Bayes* algorithms.

---

## 🚀 Features
- User-friendly web interface built with Flask  
- Predicts Iris flower type based on petal and sepal dimensions  
- Uses Machine Learning models (KNN & Naive Bayes)  
- Clean and responsive UI  

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Used
- *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)*  
- *Naive Bayes Classifier*

---

## 🧩 Dataset
The model uses the classic *Iris dataset* from scikit-learn:  
It contains 150 samples of iris flowers with features like:  
- Sepal Length  
- Sepal Width  
- Petal Length  
- Petal Width
